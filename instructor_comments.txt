Great job! Navigation looks great and is quite responsive!

- index.html --- .container aside
	No need to set a height of 100% on this. In general I avoid setting any heights unelss needed. Best practice is to let the content fill up the space needed.

- index.html --- foot nav
	I would recommend placing the | divider outside of the anchor tags. You do not want these to be clickable as they are dividers.

	Everything else looks great! excellent job.
